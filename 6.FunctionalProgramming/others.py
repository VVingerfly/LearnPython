"""
Functional programming is a style of programming that (as the name suggests)
is based around functions. A key part of functional programming is
high-order functions. High-order functions take other functions
as argument, or retutn them as results.

# Python support lists, dicnaries, tuples, sets
# When to use a dictionary:
#   - when you need a logical association between a key:value pair
#   - when you need fast lookup for your data, based on a custom Key
#   - when your data is being constantly modified. Remember, dictionaries are mutable.
# When to use the other types:
#   - use lists if you have a collection of data that does not need random access.
#     try to choose lists when you need simple, iterable collection that is modified frequently.
#   - use a set if you need uniqueness for the elements
#   - use tuples when your data cannot change.
